# Infrastructure and Codebase Audits

## Overview

This directory contains infrastructure and codebase audits for the Production Experience Showcase project. Regular audits are an essential part of maintaining reliable, secure, and efficient systems in production environments.

## Directory Structure

- `infrastructure/` - Infrastructure audit reports and findings
- `codebase/` - Codebase audit reports and findings
- `security/` - Security-specific audit reports
- `templates/` - Reusable templates and checklists for audits

## Audit Types

### Infrastructure Audits

Infrastructure audits evaluate the AWS resources, configurations, and architecture to ensure they follow best practices, are cost-effective, and meet security requirements. These audits help identify:

- Unused or underutilized resources
- Security misconfigurations
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Architectural improvements
- Compliance issues

### Codebase Audits

Codebase audits assess the quality, maintainability, and security of the application code. These audits help identify:

- Code quality issues
- Technical debt
- Security vulnerabilities
- Testing gaps
- Documentation deficiencies

### Security Audits

Security audits focus specifically on identifying potential security issues across both infrastructure and code. These audits help identify:

- Access control issues
- Data protection gaps
- Network security weaknesses
- Application security vulnerabilities
- Compliance issues with security standards

## Audit Process

Each audit follows a standardized process:

1. **Preparation**

   - Define audit scope and objectives
   - Review previous findings
   - Prepare tools and access

2. **Data Collection**

   - Gather infrastructure information
   - Analyze code repositories
   - Review configurations
   - Run automated tools

3. **Analysis**

   - Identify issues and gaps
   - Assess impact and risk
   - Prioritize findings

4. **Reporting**

   - Document findings
   - Provide remediation recommendations
   - Create actionable plans

5. **Follow-up**
   - Verify fixes
   - Track improvements
   - Update documentation

## Using the Templates

The `templates/` directory contains standardized templates for different types of audits:

- `infrastructure-audit-template.md` - Template for AWS infrastructure audits
- `codebase-audit-template.md` - Template for application code audits
- `security-audit-template.md` - Template for security-focused audits
- `audit-checklist.md` - General checklist for audit preparation and execution

To use a template:

1. Copy the appropriate template to the relevant directory
2. Rename the file with the current date (e.g., `infrastructure-audit-2025-03-15.md`)
3. Fill in the sections as you conduct the audit
4. Update the main overview document with links to the new audit

## Tools and Resources

### Infrastructure Audit Tools

- AWS CLI
- AWS Config
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- CloudWatch Metrics
- Cost Explorer

### Codebase Audit Tools

- ESLint
- SonarQube
- GitHub CodeQL
- npm audit
- Jest (for test coverage)

### Security Audit Tools

- AWS Security Hub
- OWASP ZAP
- Snyk
- AWS IAM Access Analyzer
- CloudTrail

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Cadence**: Conduct infrastructure audits bi-weekly and codebase audits monthly
2. **Documentation**: Keep thorough records of all findings and remediation steps
3. **Prioritization**: Address high-risk issues first, then work through medium and low-risk items
4. **Automation**: Automate as much of the audit process as possible
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use audit findings to improve the system and the audit process itself
