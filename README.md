## 🏛️ Infrastructure Design

The infrastructure is deployed across multiple availability zones (us-west-2a and us-west-2b) for high availability. The design includes:

- Public subnets in two AZs with direct internet access through an Internet Gateway
- Private subnets in two AZs for ECS Fargate services and RDS
- NAT Gateway in the public subnet allowing private resources to access the internet
- Application Load Balancer spanning multiple AZs for fault tolerance
- RDS PostgreSQL database with a subnet group covering multiple AZs

### 🆕 Recent Improvements

- Application Load Balancer now spans both us-west-2a and us-west-2b
- RDS database subnet group includes subnets in both us-west-2a and us-west-2b
- PostgreSQL username was updated to comply with reserved word restrictions
- NAT Gateway added to enable internet access from private subnets
- ECS task health checks optimized to use Node.js instead of curl
- ALB target group health check path updated to use /health endpoint
- Backend API enhanced with database logging for all non-metric endpoints

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

This project features a robust testing approach to ensure reliability and quality. All tests are available in the repository for review and demonstration purposes.

### Testing Locations

- **Infrastructure Tests**: Located in `__tests__/` directory
- **Backend API Tests**: Located in `backend/tests/` directory

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

To use the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, you need to add AWS credentials to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add two repository secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key

These credentials must have permissions for all the AWS services used in this project (ECR, ECS, CloudWatch, etc.).

> **Security Note**: GitHub secrets are encrypted and not visible to other users. They are only used during workflow runs and are masked in logs.

## ⚠️ Known Issues and Resolutions

Below is a summary of issues encountered and their solutions.

<details>
<summary>View Resolved Issues</summary>

1. **RDS DB Subnet Group Requirement**: AWS requires RDS instances to have subnet groups spanning at least two AZs, even for single-AZ database deployments. We resolved this by adding a second private subnet in us-west-2b.

2. **Private Subnet Internet Access**: ECS tasks in private subnets couldn't access ECR to pull Docker images. We fixed this by adding a NAT Gateway to provide internet access for resources in private subnets.

3. **Container Health Check Configuration**: The ECS task definition health check used curl, which wasn't available in the container. We changed it to use a Node.js script instead.

4. **ALB Health Check Path**: The ALB target group was checking the root path ('/') instead of the dedicated health endpoint. We updated it to use the '/health' endpoint.

5. **Test Environment Isolation**: Initial test failures occurred due to shared state between tests. We resolved this by implementing proper test isolation using Jest's `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks, ensuring each test starts with a clean state.

6. **Mock Database Connections**: Tests were failing intermittently due to improper mocking of PostgreSQL connections. We fixed this by implementing a more robust mocking strategy that properly handles connection states and error scenarios.

<summary>🛠️ Utility Scripts</summary>

The project includes several utility scripts to help with management and monitoring:

- **Resource Check Script** (`scripts/resource_check.sh`):

  - Provides comprehensive status checks of all AWS resources
  - Color-coded output for easy identification of issues
  - Covers VPC, RDS, ECS, ALB, ECR, Terraform state, and Prometheus

- **Teardown Script** (`scripts/teardown.py`):

  - Alternative to `npm run destroy` with more detailed control
  - Shows resources that will be deleted before taking action
  - Handles resources in the correct dependency order

- **Build and Push Script** (`scripts/build-and-push.sh`):
  - Builds and pushes Docker images to ECR
  - Streamlines the container deployment process

Usage:

```bash
# Check status of all AWS resources
./scripts/resource_check.sh

# Teardown infrastructure with detailed control
python scripts/teardown.py --dry-run

# Build and push Docker images
./scripts/build-and-push.sh
```

For detailed documentation on these scripts, see [scripts/RESOURCE_CHECK.md](scripts/RESOURCE_CHECK.md).
