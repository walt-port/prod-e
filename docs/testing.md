# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Production Experience Showcase project.

## Test Organization

The tests are organized in the following directories:

- **backend/tests/** - Contains all the tests for the backend services
- **infrastructure/**tests**/** - Contains tests for the infrastructure code (CDKTF)

## Backend Tests

The backend tests are written using Jest and cover the following aspects:

### Test Files

1. **api.test.js** - Tests the basic API endpoints, request handling, and response formats
2. **api-docs.test.js** - Tests the Swagger API documentation endpoints
3. **container.test.js** - Tests Docker container configuration and compatibility
4. **database.test.js** - Tests database connection and operations
5. **environment.test.js** - Tests environment variable handling
6. **health.test.js** - Tests the health check endpoint
7. **metrics.test.js** - Tests Prometheus metrics collection and exposure

### Mock Strategy

To ensure tests are consistent and don't rely on external systems, we use the following mocking strategy:

#### Centralized Mocks

- **pg.js** - A centralized mock for PostgreSQL database connections
- **aws-sdk.js** - A centralized mock for AWS SDK services

#### Mock Setup

The `setup.js` file configures Jest to use consistent mock behavior across all tests:

- Mocks are reset between test runs
- Console output is silenced during tests
- Test timeouts are set appropriately

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test
npm test -- tests/container.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline in the following ways:

1. **GitHub Actions** - Tests are run as part of the deployment workflow
2. **Pull Request Validation** - PRs require passing tests before they can be merged
3. **Deployment Gates** - Failed tests block deployment to production

## Debugging Tests

If you encounter test failures, consider the following:

1. **Check the test logs** - Look for error messages that might indicate the issue
2. **Inspect mock setup** - Verify that mocks are configured correctly
3. **Run tests individually** - Isolate failures by running specific test files

## Best Practices

When writing new tests, follow these best practices:

1. **Isolate tests** - Each test should run independently without relying on state from other tests
2. **Mock external dependencies** - Don't depend on external services or databases
3. **Test behaviors, not implementation** - Focus on what the code does, not how it does it
4. **Keep tests simple** - Each test should verify a single behavior
5. **Use descriptive test names** - The test name should clearly describe what's being tested
