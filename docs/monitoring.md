# Monitoring Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring strategy for the Production Experience Showcase project using Prometheus and Grafana. It covers the overall architecture, implementation plan, and best practices for monitoring our containerized application environment.

## Current Status

The backend application includes Prometheus metrics collection via the `prom-client` library, with a `/metrics` endpoint exposed for scraping. The full Prometheus and Grafana implementation is the next phase of the project.

### Implemented Components:

- ✅ Backend API with `/metrics` endpoint
- ✅ Custom metrics for HTTP request duration and count
- ✅ Node.js default metrics collection

### Pending Implementation:

- ⏳ Prometheus server deployment
- ⏳ Grafana deployment
- ⏳ Dashboard configuration
- ⏳ Alerting rules

## Architecture

The monitoring architecture consists of the following components:

### Prometheus

Prometheus serves as the time-series database and metrics collection system with the following responsibilities:

- Scraping metrics from the application's `/metrics` endpoint
- Storing time-series data
- Providing a query language (PromQL) for analyzing metrics
- Serving as a data source for Grafana

### Grafana

Grafana provides visualization and dashboarding capabilities:

- Multiple dashboards for different monitoring aspects
- Customizable panels and visualizations
- Alerting based on metric thresholds
- User authentication and authorization

### Metrics Collection

The application exposes metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint using several types of metrics:

1. **Custom Application Metrics**:

   - `http_request_duration_seconds`: Histogram tracking request durations
   - `http_requests_total`: Counter tracking request counts

2. **Default Node.js Metrics**:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Event loop lag
   - Active handles/requests
   - Heap statistics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Prometheus Server Setup

1. **Infrastructure Updates**:

   - Add Prometheus container to ECS task definition
   - Configure networking and security groups
   - Set up persistent storage for metrics data

2. **Prometheus Configuration**:

   - Create prometheus.yml with scrape configuration
   - Set up scrape interval and evaluation interval
   - Configure retention policies

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify Prometheus can scrape metrics from application
   - Test basic PromQL queries
   - Validate data retention

### Phase 2: Grafana Setup

1. **Infrastructure Updates**:

   - Add Grafana container to ECS task definition
   - Configure networking and security groups
   - Set up persistent storage for dashboards and settings

2. **Grafana Configuration**:

   - Configure Prometheus data source
   - Set up initial admin user
   - Configure default organization

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Application overview dashboard
   - HTTP request metrics dashboard
   - Node.js runtime metrics dashboard
   - System metrics dashboard

### Phase 3: Alerting Setup

1. **Define Alerting Rules**:

   - High error rate alerts
   - Latency threshold alerts
   - Resource utilization alerts

2. **Notification Channels**:
   - Email notifications
   - Slack integration (optional)
   - PagerDuty integration (optional)

## Expected Metrics and Dashboards

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Request Metrics**:

   - Request rate (requests per second)
   - Error rate (percentage of 4xx/5xx responses)
   - Latency (p50, p90, p99 percentiles)
   - Request duration by endpoint

2. **Resource Metrics**:

   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network I/O
   - Disk I/O (if applicable)

3. **Database Metrics**:
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Query execution time
   - Active connections
   - Database size

### Dashboard Designs

1. **Application Overview**:

   - Request rate panel
   - Error rate panel
   - Latency overview panel
   - Health status panel
   - Top endpoints by request count

2. **HTTP Detailed Dashboard**:

   - Request rate by endpoint
   - Error rate by endpoint
   - Latency heatmap
   - Status code distribution

3. **Node.js Runtime Dashboard**:

   - Event loop lag
   - Heap usage
   - Garbage collection metrics
   - Active handles/requests

4. **Infrastructure Dashboard**:
   - ECS task status
   - Container resource usage
   - ALB metrics
   - RDS metrics

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**:

   - Secure Prometheus and Grafana with authentication
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Implement role-based access control in Grafana

2. **Network Security**:

   - Restrict access to Prometheus to internal networks
   - Use security groups to control traffic
   - Place monitoring components in private subnets

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in metrics
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Secure dashboard access

## Best Practices

1. **Metric Collection**:

   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add appropriate labels for filtering
   - Focus on actionable metrics
   - Avoid high-cardinality labels

2. **Dashboard Design**:

   - Group related metrics
   - Use appropriate visualization types
   - Include descriptions for panels
   - Design for readability

3. **Alerting**:
   - Avoid alert fatigue with appropriate thresholds
   - Include runbooks or resolution steps
   - Set up escalation paths
   - Test alerts regularly
