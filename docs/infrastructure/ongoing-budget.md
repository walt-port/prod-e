## Total Budget Projections

- **Current Infrastructure**: ~$99/month
- **With Grafana Addition**: ~$114/month
- **Potential Future State**: ~$132/month

## Cost Optimization Strategies

The following strategies can be employed to optimize costs while maintaining required performance and reliability:

### 1. Scheduled Scaling/Shutdown

- **Approach**: Schedule dev/demo resources to automatically shut down during non-business hours
- **Implementation**: Use AWS EventBridge to trigger ECS service scaling to 0 during off-hours
- **Potential Savings**: ~30-40% of Fargate costs
- **Considerations**: Ensure proper startup scripts for clean init after downtime

### 2. Fargate Spot Instances

- **Approach**: Use Fargate Spot for non-critical workloads (e.g., monitoring, reporting)
- **Implementation**: Configure ECS capacity providers to use Spot instances
- **Potential Savings**: Up to 70% of Fargate costs for eligible workloads
- **Considerations**: May experience occasional interruptions; not suitable for critical services

### 3. Reserved Instances/Commitments

- **Approach**: For longer-term projects (1+ year), consider purchasing reservations
- **Implementation**: Analyze usage patterns and commit to 1-3 year terms
- **Potential Savings**: ~40% across eligible resources
- **Considerations**: Requires upfront commitment and stability in infrastructure requirements

### 4. Right-sizing Resources

- **Approach**: Continuously monitor resource utilization and adjust allocations
- **Implementation**: Use CloudWatch metrics to identify over-provisioned resources
- **Potential Savings**: 10-20% of overall costs
- **Considerations**: Requires active monitoring and periodic adjustments

## Resource Allocation Considerations

When planning for new features or services, consider the following cost-conscious approaches:

1. **Multi-purpose Infrastructure**: Where possible, leverage existing infrastructure (e.g., ALB) for new services
2. **Service Consolidation**: Group smaller services on shared instances where appropriate
3. **Serverless First**: Consider serverless options before container-based solutions for new features
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Perform cost projection for each new feature, with clear justification

## Monitoring and Reporting

To maintain visibility into costs:

1. **AWS Cost Explorer**: Review weekly for unexpected changes
2. **Budget Alerts**: Set at 80% and 100% of projected monthly spending
3. **Tagging Strategy**: Enforce tagging for all resources to track costs by feature/service
4. **Quarterly Review**: Perform comprehensive cost optimization review quarterly

## Assumptions and Caveats

- These estimates are based on AWS US West (Oregon) region pricing
- Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns, data transfer, and AWS pricing changes
- Estimates assume moderate traffic with typical diurnal patterns
- Storage costs are estimated based on current usage patterns
