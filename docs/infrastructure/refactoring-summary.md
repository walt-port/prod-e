# Infrastructure Refactoring Summary

**Date:** March 16, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of our infrastructure code from a monolithic `main.ts` file into modular components. This refactoring improves code organization, maintainability, and allows for easier collaboration among team members.

## Changes Made

1. Split the monolithic `main.ts` file (1100+ lines) into the following modular components:

   - `networking.ts` - VPC, subnets, gateways, and routing
   - `alb.ts` - Application Load Balancer and listeners
   - `ecs.ts` - ECS cluster and services
   - `rds.ts` - RDS database instance
   - `monitoring.ts` - Prometheus and Grafana services
   - `backup.ts` - S3 bucket and Lambda for backups

2. Updated `main.ts` to import and use these modular components

3. Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture:
   - Created `infrastructure.md` with an overview of the modular components
   - Updated `documentation-inventory.md` to include the new documentation

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Each file now has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't require modifying the entire infrastructure code
3. **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
4. **Simplified Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicitly defined

## Next Steps

1. Add security groups to the components where they are currently missing
2. Update placeholder ARNs with real values
3. Implement proper secrets management for sensitive values
4. Add more detailed documentation for each component
5. Implement automated tests for the infrastructure code

## Verification

The refactored code has been successfully synthesized using CDKTF, confirming that the modular approach works correctly. The generated Terraform configuration is functionally equivalent to the previous monolithic version.
