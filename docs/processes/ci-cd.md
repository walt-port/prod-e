# CI/CD Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy for the Production Experience Showcase project. The implementation uses GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deploying the application whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Current Status

### Implemented Components:

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- ✅ Automated Docker image builds for backend
- ✅ Automated Docker image builds for Prometheus
- ✅ Automated testing
- ✅ Automated infrastructure deployment

## Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following components:

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions serves as the automation platform with the following responsibilities:

- Triggering workflows based on repository events (e.g., pushes to main)
- Building and tagging Docker images
- Running automated tests
- Deploying infrastructure changes

### AWS Services

The deployment targets the following AWS services:

- Amazon ECR: For storing Docker images
- Amazon ECS: For running containerized applications
- AWS CloudWatch: For logging and monitoring
- Other AWS resources defined in the CDKTF configuration

## Workflow Details

### Trigger

The deployment workflow is triggered automatically when:

- Code is pushed to the `main` branch

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Checkout Code**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Setup Environment**: Sets up Node.js and installs the CDKTF CLI
3. **Install Dependencies**: Installs project dependencies
4. **Configure AWS**: Sets up AWS credentials for authentication
5. **Build Images**:
   - Builds the backend Docker image
   - Builds the Prometheus Docker image
   - Tags images with the latest tag
6. **Push Images**:
   - Pushes backend image to ECR
   - Pushes Prometheus image to ECR
7. **Run Tests**: Executes the backend test suite
8. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Uses CDKTF to deploy infrastructure changes

### Authentication and Secrets

The workflow uses GitHub Secrets to securely store and access sensitive information:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Access key for AWS authentication
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Secret key for AWS authentication

## Security Considerations

1. **AWS Credentials**:

   - Use an IAM user with the minimum required permissions
   - Consider using AWS OIDC (OpenID Connect) to avoid storing long-lived credentials
   - Regularly rotate credentials

2. **Docker Images**:

   - Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
   - Use specific tags rather than `latest` in production

3. **Code Security**:
   - Implement branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to main
   - Consider adding code scanning and security analysis steps

## Best Practices

1. **Pipeline Design**:

   - Keep workflows modular and maintainable
   - Follow the principle of least privilege for all service accounts
   - Include appropriate timeout and failure handling

2. **Testing**:

   - Run tests before deployment to catch issues early
   - Consider adding integration and end-to-end tests
   - Implement test coverage thresholds

3. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Validate infrastructure changes before applying
   - Consider adding a manual approval step for critical environments
   - Implement drift detection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Environment Expansion**:

   - Add support for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Implement environment-specific configuration

2. **Advanced Testing**:

   - Add integration tests between components
   - Implement smoke tests after deployment

3. **Notifications**:
   - Add Slack/email notifications for deployment status
   - Implement alerts for deployment failures
