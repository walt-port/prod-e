## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the infrastructure documentation for the Production Experience Showcase. The infrastructure is deployed on AWS using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and follows best practices for security, scalability, and reliability.

## Architecture Overview

The Production Experience Showcase architecture consists of the following key components:

### Network Layer
- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- Internet Gateway for public subnet internet access
- Security Groups to control traffic flow

### Application Delivery Layer
- Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic
- Target Groups for routing requests to appropriate services

### Compute Layer
- ECS Fargate for running containerized applications
- Task Definitions defining container configurations
- Service Definitions for managing ECS tasks

### Data Layer
- RDS PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

### Monitoring Layer
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- CloudWatch for logs and AWS service monitoring

## Infrastructure Design Principles

The infrastructure follows these key design principles:

1. **Security-First Approach**
   - Least privilege access controls
   - Network segmentation with security groups
   - Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

2. **High Availability**
   - Multi-AZ deployment for redundancy
   - Load balancing for request distribution
   - Automatic instance recovery

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - All infrastructure defined using CDK
   - Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
   - Automated deployment through CI/CD pipelines

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Resource tagging for cost allocation
   - Right-sizing of instances and services
   - Automatic cleanup of unused resources

## Deployment Workflow

Infrastructure deployment follows this general workflow:

1. Code changes are pushed to the repository
2. CI/CD pipeline is triggered
3. Infrastructure code is synthesized to CloudFormation templates
4. CloudFormation templates are deployed to AWS
5. Post-deployment verification checks are performed

For more details on the deployment process, see the [CI/CD Process](./processes/ci-cd.md) documentation.
