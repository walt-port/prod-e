# Script Fixes and Infrastructure Health Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Script Fixes

#### resource_check.sh

- Fixed the `bc` dependency issue by replacing it with bash arithmetic for EFS size calculations
- Updated the monitoring services section to correctly check for Grafana service using the proper service name
- Improved error handling and output formatting

#### monitor-health.sh

- Updated endpoint checks to use the ALB DNS name instead of internal DNS names that can't be reached
- Fixed Grafana endpoint check to handle redirects (HTTP 302) as a successful response
- Improved Prometheus endpoint check to rely on ECS service status instead of direct endpoint access
- Enhanced error messages and warnings

#### create-lambda-zip.js

- Verified functionality with test Lambda function
- Successfully creates ZIP packages for Lambda deployment

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated Grafana documentation with troubleshooting information for health issues
- Added notes about health status discrepancies between ECS tasks and monitoring scripts
- Updated scripts README with information about the recent fixes and enhancements
- Added detailed troubleshooting commands for investigating Grafana health issues

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Infrastructure Health Issues

- **Backend Service**: The backend service task is reporting as UNHEALTHY in ECS

  - This needs investigation but was not part of the current scope
  - The health check endpoint is responding correctly via the ALB

- **Prometheus Service**: The Prometheus service task is reporting as UNKNOWN in ECS

  - This is likely due to missing health check configuration in the task definition
  - The service is running but its health status cannot be determined

- **Prometheus Endpoint Access**: Prometheus is not accessible via the ALB
  - There is no listener rule configured to route traffic to Prometheus
  - Consider adding a path-based routing rule similar to Grafana

### 2. Next Steps

1. **Fix Backend Service Health**: Investigate why the backend service is reporting as UNHEALTHY
2. **Add Prometheus Health Check**: Update the Prometheus task definition to include a health check
3. **Configure Prometheus ALB Access**: Add a listener rule to route traffic to Prometheus
4. **Complete Frontend Development**: Begin work on the frontend as planned
5. **Run Comprehensive Tests**: Test all components together to ensure proper integration

## Conclusion

The script fixes have significantly improved the monitoring and management capabilities of the project. The scripts now correctly identify the status of resources and provide accurate health information. The remaining infrastructure health issues should be addressed before proceeding with frontend development to ensure a solid foundation.
