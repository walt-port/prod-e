# Script Fixes and Infrastructure Health Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Script Fixes

#### resource_check.sh

- Fixed the `bc` dependency issue by replacing it with bash arithmetic for EFS size calculations
- Updated the monitoring services section to correctly check for Grafana service using the proper service name
- Improved error handling and output formatting

#### monitor-health.sh

- Updated endpoint checks to use the ALB DNS name instead of internal DNS names that can't be reached
- Fixed Grafana endpoint check to handle redirects (HTTP 302) as a successful response
- Improved Prometheus endpoint check to rely on ECS service status instead of direct endpoint access
- Enhanced error messages and warnings

#### create-lambda-zip.js

- Verified functionality with test Lambda function
- Successfully creates ZIP packages for Lambda deployment

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated Grafana documentation with troubleshooting information for health issues
- Added notes about health status discrepancies between ECS tasks and monitoring scripts
- Updated scripts README with information about the recent fixes and enhancements
- Added detailed troubleshooting commands for investigating Grafana health issues
- Created comprehensive Prometheus documentation with configuration and access details

### 3. Infrastructure Fixes

- Fixed backend service health check by replacing `wget` with `curl` in the task definition
- Added health check to Prometheus task definition using the `/-/healthy` endpoint
- Set up ALB routing for Prometheus with a new target group and listener rule
- Configured Prometheus service to use the target group for load balancer integration

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Infrastructure Health Issues

- **Backend Service**: The backend service task should now report as HEALTHY with the improved health check

  - The health check endpoint is responding correctly via the ALB

- **Prometheus Service**: The Prometheus service task should now report as HEALTHY with the added health check
  - The service is now accessible via the ALB at the `/prometheus` path

### 2. Next Steps

1. **Complete Frontend Development**: Begin work on the frontend as planned
2. **Run Comprehensive Tests**: Test all components together to ensure proper integration
3. **Implement Alerting**: Consider adding alerting capabilities to Prometheus and Grafana

## Conclusion

The script fixes and infrastructure improvements have significantly enhanced the monitoring and management capabilities of the project. The scripts now correctly identify the status of resources and provide accurate health information. The infrastructure health issues have been addressed, with both the backend and Prometheus services now properly configured with health checks and ALB routing.
