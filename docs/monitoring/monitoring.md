## Current Status

The backend application includes Prometheus metrics collection via the `prom-client` library, with a `/metrics` endpoint exposed for scraping. Prometheus has been successfully deployed on ECS Fargate and is now scraping metrics from the backend application.

### Implemented Components

- ✅ Backend API with `/metrics` endpoint
- ✅ Custom metrics for HTTP request duration and count
- ✅ Node.js default metrics collection
- ✅ Prometheus server deployment on ECS Fargate
- ✅ Grafana deployment with persistent storage (EFS)
- ✅ Dashboard configuration for Node.js and HTTP metrics
- ✅ Alerting rules for high event loop lag

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Planned)

- ⏳ Advanced dashboard customization and templates
- ⏳ Business metrics implementation
- ⏳ Multi-service metric collection
- ⏳ Advanced alerting with notification channels
- ⏳ Long-term metrics storage with Prometheus remote write
- ⏳ SLO/SLI tracking and reporting

## Architecture

The monitoring architecture consists of the following components:

### Prometheus

Prometheus serves as the time-series database and metrics collection system with the following responsibilities:

- Scraping metrics from the application's `/metrics` endpoint via ALB
- Storing time-series data
- Providing a query language (PromQL) for analyzing metrics
- Serving as a data source for Grafana

### Grafana

Grafana provides visualization and dashboarding capabilities:

- Multiple dashboards for different monitoring aspects
- Customizable panels and visualizations
- Alerting based on metric thresholds
- User authentication and authorization

### Metrics Collection

The application exposes metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint using several types of metrics:

1. **Custom Application Metrics**:

   - `http_request_duration_seconds`: Histogram tracking request durations
   - `http_requests_total`: Counter tracking request counts

2. **Default Node.js Metrics**:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Event loop lag
   - Active handles/requests
   - Heap statistics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Prometheus Server Setup (✅ Completed)

1. **Infrastructure Updates**:

   - ✅ Add Prometheus container to ECS task definition
   - ✅ Configure networking and security groups
   - ✅ Deploy Prometheus on ECS Fargate

### Phase 2: Grafana Implementation (✅ Completed)

1. **Infrastructure Setup**:

   - ✅ Create EFS filesystem with appropriate access points
   - ✅ Deploy Grafana on ECS Fargate (single-AZ for cost efficiency)
   - ✅ Configure ALB path-based routing for `/grafana`
   - ✅ Set up AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
   - ✅ Implement S3-based backup solution

2. **Dashboard Configuration**:

   - ✅ Configure Prometheus data source
   - ✅ Create Node.js metrics dashboard
   - ✅ Set up HTTP request metrics dashboard
   - ✅ Configure basic alerting rules

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring Features (⏳ Planned)

1. **Advanced Dashboard Development**:

   - Create customizable dashboard templates
   - Build executive summary dashboard
   - Implement infrastructure overview dashboard
   - Add user behavior and business metrics visualizations

2. **Enhanced Alerting System**:

   - Configure multi-channel notifications (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
   - Implement alert grouping and deduplication
   - Create alert severity levels and escalation paths
   - Develop alert runbooks and documentation

3. **Long-term Metrics Storage**:

   - Configure Prometheus remote write to long-term storage
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Set up historical data analysis capabilities
   - Create metrics compression and aggregation strategy

4. **SLO/SLI Implementation**:

   - Define service level objectives
   - Implement SLI metrics collection
   - Create SLO dashboards and reporting
   - Set up error budget tracking and visualization

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement enhanced authentication for Grafana
   - Configure role-based access control
   - Audit logging and monitoring access
   - Secure dashboard sharing capabilities

For detailed Grafana implementation information, see [Grafana Documentation](./grafana.md).

## Prometheus Deployment Details

Prometheus has been deployed with the following configuration:

1. **ECS Task Definition**:

   - Family: `prom-task`
   - CPU: 256 (0.25 vCPU)
   - Memory: 512 MB
   - Image: Custom Prometheus image with configuration

2. **Configuration**:

   - Scrape interval: Default (15s)
   - Target: Backend service via ALB (`application-load-balancer-XXXXX.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:3000`)
   - Path: `/metrics`

3. **Security**:

   - Runs in private subnets
   - Limited security group access (only from ALB)
   - Uses IAM role with appropriate CloudWatch permissions

4. **Logging**:
   - Logs available in CloudWatch under `/ecs/prom-task`
   - Container logs showing successful startup and scrape operations

## Expected Metrics and Dashboards

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Request Metrics**:

   - Request rate (requests per second)
   - Error rate (percentage of 4xx/5xx responses)
   - Latency (p50, p90, p99 percentiles)
   - Request duration by endpoint

2. **Resource Metrics**:

   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network I/O
   - Disk I/O (if applicable)

3. **Database Metrics**:
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Query execution time
   - Active connections
   - Database size

### Dashboard Designs

1. **Application Overview**:

   - Request rate panel
   - Error rate panel
   - Latency overview panel
   - Health status panel
   - Top endpoints by request count

2. **HTTP Detailed Dashboard**:

   - Request rate by endpoint
   - Error rate by endpoint
   - Latency heatmap
   - Status code distribution

3. **Node.js Runtime Dashboard**:

   - Event loop lag
   - Heap usage
   - Garbage collection metrics
   - Active handles/requests

4. **Infrastructure Dashboard**:
   - ECS task status
   - Container resource usage
   - ALB metrics
   - RDS metrics

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**:

   - Secure Prometheus and Grafana with authentication
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Implement role-based access control in Grafana

2. **Network Security**:

   - Restrict access to Prometheus to internal networks
   - Use security groups to control traffic
   - Place monitoring components in private subnets

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in metrics
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Secure dashboard access

## Best Practices

1. **Metric Collection**:

   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add appropriate labels for filtering
   - Focus on actionable metrics
   - Avoid high-cardinality labels

2. **Dashboard Design**:

   - Group related metrics
   - Use appropriate visualization types
   - Include descriptions for panels
   - Design for readability

3. **Alerting**:
   - Avoid alert fatigue with appropriate thresholds
   - Include runbooks or resolution steps
   - Set up escalation paths
   - Test alerts regularly
